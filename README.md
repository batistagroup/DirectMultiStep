## Overview

- [Data/Dataset.py](/Data/Dataset.py) definition of custom torch Datasets used for training and evaluation.
- [Data/process.py](/Data/process.py) scripts to preprocess PaRoutes dataset and create training and evaluation partitions.
- [Models/Architecture.py](/Models/Architecture.py) contains definitions of Encoder, Decoder, and combining Seq2Seq module.
- [Models/Training.py](/Models/Training.py) definition of Lightning Training class
- [Models/Configure.py](/Models/Configure.py) definiton of model config
- [Models/Generation.py](/Models/Generation.py) implementation of beam search using python lists
- [Models/TensorGen.py](/Models/TensorGen.py) implementation of beam search using torch.Tensors to maximize GPU efficiency. Warning: the current algorithm works properly only with batch_size=1 inputs (PRs welcome).

For training see:

- [train_nosm.py](/train_nosm.py) - w/o SM provided to encoder
- [train_wsm.py](/train_wsm.py) - w/ SM provided to encoder

Once everything is set up, it's suffice to simply run `python train_wsm.py`.

Run `bash download_ckpts.sh` to download our checkpoints from the file storage.

## Tutorials

To use the tutorials, simply move/copy them to the root directory. This is necessary because the notebooks use relative imports.

- [Tutorials/Basic_Usage.ipynb](/Tutorials/Basic_Usage.ipynb) walks you through how to input your compounds, steps, and starting materials. Visualization of routes in PDF is shown. 
- [Tutorials/Route_Separation.ipynb](/Tutorials/Route_Separation.ipynb) reproduces the route separation results from the paper.
- [Tutorials/Pharma_Compounds.ipynb](/Tutorials/Pharma_Compounds.ipynb) reproduces the three FDA-approved drug results from the paper.
